## Table Codes from ACS

I'll make this another page linked here.

[Table Codes](https://www.notion.so/Table-Codes-99d828f7bf3044439c15195d1a95e5b8)

We are, for the moment, focusing on two of these tables: 01 Age and Sex, and 02 Race.

- The code for the Age and Sex table is B01001.
- Race: This is a slightly complicated table to approach. The Census Data proceeds as if a person has 1 race, but the form can be filled with as many as 6 races. They also do not consider hispanic/latino origin as a race.
    - [B02001](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B02001/): Includes numbers for people with a single racial identity
    - [B02003](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B02003/): Includes data for multiple race selections (two or more, three or more, etc.) but does not include hispanic/latina. Because the columns in B02003 are so detailed, this table is only available for the entire US, and is only included in the 1-year and 3-year ACS releases. If you want similar information for any other geographies or for the 5-year ACS, use table [C02003](https://censusreporter.org/tables/C02003/).
    - [B03003](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B03003/): Hispanic/Not Hispanic
    - [B03002](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B03002/): Hispanic/Not Hispanic with White alone, Black alone, etc.


> **Note:** The tables, B01001, C02003, and B03002, were downloaded on a local machine. There is a possibility that some tables failed to download when the internet connection dropped a couple of times. If you find a table missing, please let me know.
