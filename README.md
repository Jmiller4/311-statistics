# 311-statistics
Statistics on 311 response times in Chicago for graffitti removal requests

output.txt has statistics from historical database only.
output_all_past_2005.txt has statistics from historical and current databases.

Both ignore requests made past 2005. The code has options for doing statistics on both or just one database, and allows you to not ignore requests before a certain year, or to change the year before which requests should be ignored.
